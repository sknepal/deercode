## Synopsis

**DeerCode** is a work in progress. It is meant for students at [Deerwalk Institute of Technology](http://www.dwit.edu.np). It is where students can log in and solve different programming related questions. At this moment, however, it only allows students to view the questions submitted by the administrator on the other end.


## Motivation

DeerCode is my project for the Term Paper that we have to do every semester.

## Installation

You need Bootstrap in order to view the site properly. Since I used Bootstrap, I have not included the JS, CSS and fonts folder here. First, download the files to your localhost in the same hierarchy. Then [download Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download) and extract the contents of it to the same directory. Also, extract the contents of Bootstrap once more to the /admin/ directory.
